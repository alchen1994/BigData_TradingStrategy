## The file named as "dqn_full.py" is for the comparative experiment with random walk as benchmark. 
## The files named as "dqn_full_e.py", "dqn_add_s_e.py" and "dqn_add_fnc_e.py" is for the comparative experiments to analyse the effect of semantic data as well as finantial indicator data.
### The file "dqn_full_e.py" denotes DQN model with no augmentation;
### The file "dqn_add_s_e.py" denotes DQN model augmented with semantic score;
### The file "dqn_add_s_e.py" denotes DQN model augmented with VIX (the selected finantial indicator);
